Voy a probar el m칩dulo PAM de Google Authenticator para a침adir una capa extra de seguridad a la hora
de acceder por SSH

Sigo las instrucciones del pdf: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11rzhMdI5zVRcL1c9maBqCH7My_bAUls3/view?usp=sharing

vagrant@ubuntu-bionic:~$ google-authenticator

Do you want authentication tokens to be time-based (y/n) y
Warning: pasting the following URL into your browser exposes the OTP secret to Google:

Your new secret key is: 
Your verification code is 
Your emergency scratch codes are:

Do you want me to update your "/home/vagrant/.google_authenticator" file? (y/n) y

Do you want to disallow multiple uses of the same authentication
token? This restricts you to one login about every 30s, but it increases
your chances to notice or even prevent man-in-the-middle attacks (y/n) y

By default, a new token is generated every 30 seconds by the mobile app.
In order to compensate for possible time-skew between the client and the server,
we allow an extra token before and after the current time. This allows for a
time skew of up to 30 seconds between authentication server and client. If you
experience problems with poor time synchronization, you can increase the window
from its default size of 3 permitted codes (one previous code, the current
code, the next code) to 17 permitted codes (the 8 previous codes, the current
code, and the 8 next codes). This will permit for a time skew of up to 4 minutes
between client and server.
Do you want to do so? (y/n) y

If the computer that you are logging into isn't hardened against brute-force
login attempts, you can enable rate-limiting for the authentication module.
By default, this limits attackers to no more than 3 login attempts every 30s.
Do you want to enable rate-limiting? (y/n) y

Al hacer SSH desde otra m치quina, nos pide el c칩digo:
